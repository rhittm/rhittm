Your Instagram posts are always on time! Rhittm provides popularity as a service.

Rhittm analyses Instagram activity insights and suggests you when to post to get the most out of it. It also suggests the most popular hashtags to give your creativity a jump-start.

## How it works

1. We analyse instagram. We track overall Instagram activity to figure out the best time to post. We also analyse hashtags to handpick the most popular ones.

2. You Post. You check the time, grab the hashtags and post your content on Instagram.

3. You become popular. As more people see your content because of precisely picked posting time and hashtags, you gain popularity.
